# Arkoa
A basic Text-Based RPG game made in Python 2.7.6

# Game

You are a Warrior, Ranger, Berserker, Mage or Summoner in the land of Arkoa.
The game is using a CLI, and it is actually playable.
You are the hero who will defend Arkoa from evil, and eventually, you will
have to face the greatest challenge within your lifetime.

# Features

* 5 Classes, the ability to pick your name and gender.
* A Chapter-Based RPG experience on your command line. [Graphical version will come eventually!]
* A shop, a statistics page and an equipment system, along with various spells.
* Very small size, due to no graphics.
